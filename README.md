## Principles of Islamic Finance

Islamic finance is guided by several key principles that distinguish it
from conventional finance:

-   **Prohibition of interest (riba)**: The charging or paying of
    interest is considered usury and is forbidden in Islam.
-   **Prohibition of gambling (gharar)**: Transactions involving
    excessive risk or uncertainty are not permitted.
-   **Sharing of risk and reward**: Islamic finance emphasizes the
    sharing of both risk and reward between parties engaged in a
    transaction.
-   **Compliance with Islamic law (Sharia)**: All financial activities
    must adhere to the principles of Islamic law.

Based on the principles of Islamic finance, Quotex trading can be
considered halal for the following reasons:

-   **Absence of interest**: Quotex does not charge or pay interest on
    its trading platform.

    rather than pure chance or speculation.
